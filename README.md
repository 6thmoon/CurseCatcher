## Introduction

This one's for all the **REX** players out there. By default, all it does is prevent **Eclipse 8**'s "permanent curse" debuff from being applied when spending health on ability costs. In addition to the obvious implications for *Seed Barrage*, *Bramble Volley*, and *Tangling Growth*, this also affects corrupted **Void Fiend**'s special skill.

However, configuration options are also available for other forms of self-inflicted damage such as friendly fire (e.g. *OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike*), fall damage, and interactables like *Shrine of Blood*. An optional **Artifact of Infliction** can be enabled in both the **Eclipse** lobby and other game modes to allow players to easily toggle the above functionality.
